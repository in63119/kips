## Simple Summary
This document suggests an on-chain database linking addresses to readable labels for easier understanding in interfaces. It enables direct access to label data and supports community-driven, decentralized label management.

## Abstract
This document proposes an on-chain label database storing a mapping between addresses and human-readable labels. It aims to enhance comprehensibility of accounts in user interfaces. By implementing as an on-chain contract, it allows users and service providers to access label information without the need for a separate API. Additionally, it allows decentralized contribution through community-based label administration and verification.

## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for KIPs that want to change the Klaytn protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the KIP solves. KIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

## Specification
<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Klaytn platforms (klaytn). -->


## Backwards Compatibility
<!-- All KIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The KIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. KIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright. The authors should answer the question: "Does this KIP require a hard fork?" -->
